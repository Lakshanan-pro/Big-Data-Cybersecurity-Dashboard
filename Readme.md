üìÅ File Structure
cybersecurity-dashboard/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate_data.js       # Node.js script to generate sample data
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ incidents.json         # Generated cybersecurity incidents dataset
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dashboard.html         # Main dashboard web application
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This documentation file
üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (for data generation script)
Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
Local web server (optional, for CORS compliance)
Quick Start
Generate Sample Data
bash
   # Run the data generator
   node generate_data.js
This creates incidents.json with 100 sample cybersecurity incidents.

Launch Dashboard
Option A (Simple): Double-click dashboard.html
Option B (Recommended): Use a local web server
bash
     # Python 3
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Python 2
     python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
     
     # Node.js (if you have http-server installed)
     npx http-server
Navigate to http://localhost:8000/dashboard.html
View Dashboard
The dashboard will automatically load incidents.json
Critical incident alerts will appear in the top-right corner
Use filters to analyze specific incident types or severities
üìä Data Schema
Each incident in incidents.json contains:

json
{
  "id": "uuid-string",                    // Unique identifier
  "timestamp": "2025-09-21T14:32:15.742Z", // ISO 8601 timestamp
  "source": "firewall",                   // Source: firewall, antivirus, cloud_audit
  "severity": "critical",                 // Severity: low, medium, high, critical
  "event_type": "suspicious_connection",  // Event type (5 types available)
  "src_ip": "192.168.1.45",              // Source IPv4 address
  "dst_ip": "10.0.0.23",                 // Destination IPv4 address
  "user": "unknown",                      // User involved (8 predefined users)
  "host": "host-012.example.com",         // Target host (host-001 to host-050)
  "threat_score": 85,                     // Threat level (1-100)
  "description": "Simulated event for demo" // Event description
}
Event Types

Severity Levels
Critical: Immediate attention required (red)
High: High priority incidents (orange)
Medium: Moderate priority (yellow)
Low: Informational events (green)

üîß Customization
Modifying Data Generation
Edit generate_data.js to customize:

Number of incidents (INCIDENT_COUNT)
Available sources, severities, event types
User names and host ranges
Time range for incident generation
Dashboard Styling
Modify CSS variables in dashboard.html:

Color schemes
Chart dimensions
Layout breakpoints
Animation timings
Adding New Features
The modular JavaScript structure allows easy extension:

Additional chart types
New filter categories
Enhanced alert mechanisms
Export functionality

üîç Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Dashboard shows "Loading..." forever
Ensure incidents.json is in the same directory
Check browser console for CORS errors
Use a local web server instead of file:// protocol
Charts not displaying
Verify Chart.js CDN is accessible
Check network connection for CDN resources
Inspect browser console for JavaScript errors
No data generation
Ensure Node.js is installed
Run node --version to verify installation
Check file permissions in the directory
Alerts not appearing
Verify there are critical incidents in the data
Check if browser is blocking popups
Look for JavaScript errors in console
Debug Mode
Open browser developer tools (F12) and check:

Console for error messages
Network tab for failed resource loads
Elements tab for DOM structure
